<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">About this scheme</h1>
<p class="govuk-body">The teacherâ€™s student loan reimbursement scheme rewards teachers for teaching priority subjects
in eligible parts of England.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">If you are eligible, you can claim back loan repayments from the last year.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">You can make an application in September after the end of an academic year.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Repayments are not classed as part of your pay. You will not have to pay tax
or National Insurance on them.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">We will ask the school you taught at to confirm what you tell us about your employment there. </p>
