      <p class="govuk-body">Dear {name}</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The Department for Education thinks that you may be eligible for the Teacherâ€™s Student Loan Reimbursement (TSLR) scheme.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">TSLR allows eligible teachers to claim a reimbursement for student loan payments for the preceding year. It is a reward for staff who are:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>working in state schools in specific parts of the country</li>
        <li>in years 1 to 5 of their career</li>
        <li>spending at least 50% of their time teaching languages (excluding English), science or computer science.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>What you need to do now</strong></p>
      <p class="govuk-body">If you think you may be eligible, you need to make sure your details are up to date on the database of qualified teachers (DQT).</p>
      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>What happens next</strong></p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We will contact you shortly to tell you how to apply. We will use information from DQT to verify your application.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You can <a href="#">read more about the TSLR scheme on GOV.UK </a></p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Kind regards</p>
