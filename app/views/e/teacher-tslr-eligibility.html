      <p class="govuk-body">To claim back student loan payments made through your wages between {{ globals.tax_year.start_date }} and {{ globals.tax_year.end_date }} (the last tax year), you must:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>have qualified as a teacher after {{ globals.eligibility_criteria.qualified_date }}</li>
        <li>still be employed at a school in the UK</li>
        <li>have been employed at a state-funded school or academy, or in a 'special school' (a school with pupils who have special educational needs) in the last tax year</li>

        <li>have spent most of your time at the school teaching 11 to 16 year olds or, if you were on leave or off sick, have been employed to teach this age range</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">If you worked in a state-funded school or academy you must also have taught, or been employed to teach, at least one of these subjects for most of the last tax year:</p>
